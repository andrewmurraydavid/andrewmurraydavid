## Hey, I'm Andrew 👋

Software Engineer, IT Consultant, and Owner of Maranatha Tech Solutions. I'm passionate about delivering comprehensive technology solutions and fostering strong client partnerships.

JavaScript and TypeScript enthusiast who enjoys tackling complex problems with clean, efficient code. In my free time, I create personal projects with self-imposed deadlines to keep my skills sharp.

## Hey, I'm Andrew 👋

I am a fullstack developer with a huge passion for technology.
I'm also a JavaScript and Typescript hard-core fan.

In the free time, I like creating projects, establishing mini deadlines to practice writing clean code in a timely manner and basically just learning new things.

I am a big advocate of microservice based systems. Change my mind! 😄

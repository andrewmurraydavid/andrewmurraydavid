## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Andrew.

I am a fullstack developer with a huge passion for technology.

In the free time, I like creating small projects, establishing mini deadlines to practice writing clean code in a timely manner and basically just learning new things.

I have worked with several languages until now, but I must admit that I am a JavaScript hard-core fan.

---

I am a big advocate of microservice based systems. Change my mind! ðŸ˜„
